HOW TO RUN:-
The repository if cloned will have a folder DA_Project/DataBases
The python notebook contains cells which show the current working directory and allow u to change it to the one shown above

i.e ../DA_Project/DataBases

OVERVIEW:-

Crime against women data analysis 

Covariance and Correlational Analysis

These 2 types of analysis are critical for the creation of a model as it shows us which 
features are strongly related and which vary from the mean the most.

2 Types of Models Prepared:

Linear regression :
Defining a variable and performing regression on the complete set of crimes 
commited in India against women

Regression Analysis between Urban and Rural and on States for different crimes

Clustering :

All columns excluding place,year,rape and kidnapping have been 
droppped from the dataset.The dataset has been arranged in desceneding order depending on the sum of rapes and kidnappings
and a set of urban and rural places have been chosen from it.

A subset of the crimes in 2011 has been chosen for prediction clustering.The places are clustered based on crimes per capita
The model has been used to cluster data from 2004 and 2008
