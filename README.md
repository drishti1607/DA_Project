Time-series: Rate of crimes in urban and rural areas<br>
Multiple linear regression<br>
Clustering<br>
<br>

Heat map of India for crimes per capita.<br>
Pick 6 locations based on heat map intensities (6-6 based on urbanization).<br>
Assign weights to crimes based on length of sentence and calculate safety index for the cities chosen: Multiple regression.<br>
Use clustering (k means or SVM) to check if there is a clear boundary between urban and rural<br>
