Multiple linear regression
Clustering


Heat map of India for crimes per capita.
Pick 6 locations based on heat map intensities (6-6 based on urbanization).
Assign weights to crimes based on length of sentence and calculate safety index for the cities chosen: Multiple regression.
Use clustering (k means or SVM) to check if there is a clear boundary between urban and rural
